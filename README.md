# Perry Agent Project
The Perry Agent is a project that consists of two mobile applications: a user app and an admin app. The user app allows the collection of user data, such as SMS and call logs, and also provides the ability to remotely create calls or send SMS. The admin app, on the other hand, displays a list of mobile devices with installed applications.

The project is developed using Java language and Firebase Realtime Database is used for the database.
